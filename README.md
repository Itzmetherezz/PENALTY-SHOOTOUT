2. Open the file usin visual studio.
3. Run the build and play the game.

- Use the mouse to point and click on the targets.
- The goalkeeper will jump in a random direction and you have to try to use your luck to shoot in a different direction.
- If he stops the ball 3 times you lose.
- Try to get a high score.
